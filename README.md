### Project 1: Student Management System
A dynamic system for managing student records using a linked list.

- **Functions**: Add, update, delete, and search records by ID.
- **Features**: Calculates average GPA and identifies the highest GPA.

### Project 2: Stopwatch
A dual-mode stopwatch with six multiplexed seven-segment displays.

- **Modes**: Countup and Countdown.
- **Controls**: External interrupts for reset, pause, and resume.
- **Adjustments**: Set hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Indicators**: Buzzer and LED signals for countdown completion and mode display.

### Project 3: Smart Home System
An automated home control system with flame detection and light control using an LDR sensor.

- **Appliance Control**: Manages lights and fans based on environmental conditions.
- **Fire Detection**: Triggers an alert if flames are detected.
- **LDR Integration**: Controls lighting based on ambient light levels.

### Project 4: Car Parking System
An ultrasonic sensor-based parking assistant to monitor distance and alert the driver.

- **Distance Display**: Shows distance in centimeters on an LCD.
- **Alerts**: LED and buzzer signals for proximity warnings.

### Final Project: Dual Microcontroller Door Locker Security System
A secure door-locking system using two ATmega32 microcontrollers for password-based access control.

- **Password Authentication**: Allows three attempts for correct entry; locks for 1 minute with an alarm after three failed attempts.
- **LCD Interface**: Displays entry status and error messages.
- **Dual Microcontroller Setup**: Separates HMI and control functions for modularity and performance.
- **Security Features**: Buzzer alert for security breaches and system lockout on repeated incorrect entries.
